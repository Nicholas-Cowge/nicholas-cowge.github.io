      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find information about me, my school projects, as well as a few personal projects. Feel free to visit older portfolios, but don't expect them to be as well formatted as this one.</p>
      <h3>What you'll find in each section</h3>
      <p>The "DRSS" section isn't really a section. That button is just a link to the offical school website.</p>
	  <p>The "Portfolio" dropdown has links to previous portfolio websites, so you can see what projects I did in previous years. But let's be honest, the most notable thing about them is how bad the websites look when compared to this one. Hosting for some of them has been pretty hit-or-miss, so don't be surprised if you wind up with a 404.</p>

      <h2>What I have planned for this site</h2>
      <p>I plan on documenting all of my personal projects here at some point in the future. Unless I have oodles of free time next year, there probably won't be any major changes to the asthetics of this site. Future portfolios will also probably come in the form of additions to this site. If you are firmiliar with the portfolios of other people at DRSS, you will probably have noticed that this site's URL is a bit different from the others. This is because it is not being hosted on the school servers. I am doing this because the school server has tons of hoops to jump through just to do trivial tasks, such as show a video or use i-frames. It also requires a password that will likley become invalid when I graduate, which is kind of a big deal since I want to be able to make updates here for years and years to come. The only interaction I see myself having with the school server in the future is making a simple redirect that leads here.</p>
